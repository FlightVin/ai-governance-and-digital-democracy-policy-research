# AI Governance & Digital Democracy Policy Research

Policy analysis examining the global implications of extending European Union digital governance frameworks, prepared for a Model United Nations General Assembly simulation.

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive policy research analyzing the feasibility and implications of globalizing the EU's digital governance framework, including:
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Digital Services Act (DSA)**
- **Digital Markets Act (DMA)**
- **Data Governance Act (DGA)**

The research was conducted from the perspective of the United States delegation, examining technical feasibility, economic impacts, and regulatory trade-offs across jurisdictions with varying capabilities.

## Documents

- **[Position Paper](D3GEU_Position_Paper.pdf)** - Initial policy stance outlining U.S. concerns regarding innovation constraints, compliance burdens, and regulatory fragmentation
- **[Summary Analysis](D3GEU_Summary.pdf)** - Comprehensive synthesis of caucus discussions, incorporating perspectives from multiple delegations and examining act-specific challenges

## Key Research Areas

### 1. **Technical Feasibility Analysis**
- Infrastructure requirements for implementing EU-style data governance in developing economies
- Resource constraints for real-time content moderation and independent data intermediaries
- Cybersecurity implications of data localization mandates

### 2. **Economic Impact Assessment**
- Compliance cost analysis: $8.6B spent by U.S. firms on GDPR, projected $22-50B for DSA/DMA
- SME market exit rates (25% of UK SMEs withdrew from EU markets)
- Venture capital disparities: EU AI funding (€6.2B) vs. U.S. ($42B) in 2024

### 3. **Innovation Trade-offs**
- AI dataset availability reduction (estimated 33% due to consent restrictions)
- LLM development concentration (2/20 top models from EU developers)
- Regulatory burden asymmetries between large and small firms

### 4. **Regulatory Fragmentation**
- Cross-border data flow uncertainties (EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework disputes)
- Adequacy assessment inconsistencies across jurisdictions
- Risk of regulatory arbitrage within supposedly harmonized frameworks

## Research Methodology

The analysis employed:

1. **Multi-stakeholder perspective integration** - Synthesized viewpoints from government delegations (U.S., EU, India, China, Japan, UK, South Africa, Brazil), technology companies (Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, X/Twitter), and civil society organizations

2. **Act-specific examination** - Detailed critique of each regulatory component:
   - GDPR: Right to erasure vs. blockchain immutability, consent fatigue, adequacy determinations
   - DGA: Data intermediary viability (only 11 registered services globally), data altruism skepticism
   - DSA: Content moderation overreach, "illegal content" definition ambiguity, algorithmic audit concerns
   - DMA: Gatekeeper designation bias (6/7 U.S. companies), interoperability cost analysis (Apple's $3.2B USB-C transition)

3. **Comparative framework analysis** - Evaluated alternative governance models:
   - U.S.: Sectoral approach (CCPA, CLOUD Act), APEC CBPR system
   - India: Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act with adaptive thresholds
   - China: Cyber sovereignty model with state-controlled data flows
   - Brazil: LGPD with local context adaptation

## Policy Recommendations

The research advocates for:
- **Flexible, risk-based approaches** over prescriptive blanket regulations
- **Mutual recognition frameworks** enabling cross-border data flows between jurisdictions with compatible protections
- **Tiered compliance requirements** scaled to organizational size and risk profile
- **Multi-stakeholder governance councils** with equal representation and transparent decision-making
- **Regulatory sandboxes** for safe experimentation with emerging technologies

## Context

This research was developed for the General Assembly session of a Model United Nations conference, where delegates debated whether EU digital governance frameworks should become the global standard. The position and summary papers reflect extensive deliberation incorporating economic data, technical constraints, and diverse geopolitical perspectives.

## Key Insights

> "The most pressing objections came from developing economies and delegations representing small and medium-sized enterprises... The prospect of dedicating a high amount of resources threatens to annihilate innovators before they can grow."

> "Rather than supporting a monolithic framework, delegates pushed for diverse models that are customized to different priorities and capabilities... Each balances privacy, innovation, and security in ways that make sense locally."

> "Despite the positive intentions that reside in the EU's digital governance framework, they are not well suited for universalisation... There is thus a need to listen to varied views and on a deeper level understand that not all countries share similar resources and needs."
